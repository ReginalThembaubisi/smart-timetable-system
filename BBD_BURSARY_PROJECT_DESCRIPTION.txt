Smart Timetable Management System

I developed a comprehensive Smart Timetable Management System as part of my ICT Application Development studies at University of Mpumalanga. This full-stack application demonstrates my proficiency in multiple technologies and real-world problem-solving.

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Backend: PHP with MySQL database, RESTful API architecture
- Frontend: Flutter mobile application (cross-platform)
- Database: Designed and implemented relational database with proper normalization
- Tools: XAMPP, Composer, Git version control

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

For Students (Mobile App):
- Secure authentication system with student login
- Real-time timetable viewing (daily and weekly views)
- Module management and enrollment tracking
- Study session planning and tracking
- Built-in study timer functionality
- Exam timetable with notifications
- Offline data access capability

For Administrators (Web Interface):
- Complete student management system (CRUD operations)
- Module and course management
- Lecturer and venue management
- Timetable creation and editing interface
- Exam scheduling system
- Bulk data import/export functionality
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Designed database schema with proper relationships and foreign keys
- Implemented RESTful APIs for mobile app communication
- Created responsive admin web interface
- Developed cross-platform mobile application using Flutter
- Implemented secure password hashing and authentication
- Built data synchronization between mobile app and server
- Created PDF parsing functionality for exam timetable import
- Implemented bulk operations for efficient data management

PROJECT SCOPE:
This was a substantial project that required:
- Full system architecture design
- Database design and optimization
- API development and documentation
- Mobile app UI/UX design
- Integration testing
- Error handling and user feedback systems

The system is fully functional and demonstrates my ability to work with both frontend and backend technologies, manage complex data relationships, and create user-friendly interfaces. I successfully led the development process from initial design through to completion, solving technical challenges along the way.

The project is available on my GitHub: github.com/ReginalThembaubisi/smart-timetable-system

This project showcases my passion for software development, problem-solving abilities, and commitment to creating practical solutions that can benefit educational institutions.
