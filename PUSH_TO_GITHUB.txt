After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

1. Add the remote repository:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/ReginalThembaubisi/smart-timetable-system.git

2. Rename branch to main (if needed):
   git branch -M main

3. Push to GitHub:
   git push -u origin main

If you get authentication errors, you may need to:
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or use GitHub Desktop app
