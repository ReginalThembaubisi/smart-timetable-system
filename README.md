## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **XAMPP** (includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP)
- **Flutter SDK** (latest stable version)
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** (with Flutter extensions)
- **Composer** (PHP package manager)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Database Setup
1. Start XAMPP and ensure MySQL is running
2. Open phpMyAdmin (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`)
3. Create a new database or use existing one
4. Import the `database_setup.sql` file to create all required tables
   - File location: [`database_setup.sql`](https://github.com/ReginalThembaubisi/smart-timetable-system/blob/main/admin/database_setup.sql)
   - Or use the file in the repository root: `admin/database_setup.sql`

#### 2. Backend Setup (Admin Panel)
1. Copy the `admin` folder to your XAMPP `htdocs` directory
   - Default path: `C:\xampp\htdocs\admin`
2. Open `admin/config.php` and verify database settings:
   ```php
   // Default XAMPP settings usually work:
   // Host: localhost
   // Username: root
   // Password: (empty)
   // Database: smart_timetable
   ```
3. Install PHP dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   cd admin
   composer install
   ```
4. Access the admin panel at: `http://localhost/admin`

#### 3. Mobile App Setup (Flutter)
1. Open the Flutter project in Android Studio or VS Code
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Configure API endpoint in `lib/config/app_config.dart`:
   ```dart
   // For Android Emulator:
   static const String apiBaseUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2/admin';
   
   // For Physical Device (replace with your computer's IP):
   static const String apiBaseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.XXX/admin';
   
   // For Web:
   static const String apiBaseUrl = 'http://localhost/admin';
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The Flutter mobile app communicates with the backend through these REST API endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST student_login_api.php` - Student login authentication

### Timetable
- `GET get_student_timetable.php?student_id={id}` - Retrieve student's class schedule
- `GET get_student_exam_timetable.php?student_id={id}` - Retrieve exam schedule

### Modules
- `GET student_modules_api.php?student_id={id}` - Get modules enrolled by student
- `GET fetch_all_modules.php` - Get all available modules in the system

### Profile Management
- `POST update_student_profile.php` - Update student information
- `POST change_password_api.php` - Change student password

> **Note:** Replace `{id}` with the actual student ID in the URL parameters.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The system uses MySQL database with the following main tables:

| Table Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `students` | Stores student information (name, student number, contact details) |
| `modules` | Course modules and their details |
| `sessions` | Class timetable entries (time, day, module, lecturer, venue) |
| `lecturers` | Lecturer information and contact details |
| `venues` | Classroom and location information |
| `exams` | Exam schedules and details |
| `student_modules` | Junction table linking students to their enrolled modules |

> Import `database_setup.sql` to create all tables with proper relationships and constraints.
